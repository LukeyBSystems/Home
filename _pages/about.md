Here you'll find a collection of projects of whatever it is that has captured my imagination lately. In the past  I've built automated crypto trading bots, implemented new machine learning architectures and loads of other unfinished ideas across mobile apps to data science tools. I'm deep into game dev at the moment, building tools and prototyping games.

Apart from programming, I really enjoy rock climbing to keep fit and push myself, and golf for a more relaxing challenge.

If you want to see my past work, check my GitHub account out or if you want to contact me you can shoot me a message on LinkedIn, links are on the left.

Happy coding!
